this is a website that Analyse a stocks volatility, SMA (10 days), EMA (10 days). And it predicts the stock price for the next day. it uses a simple Linear Regression model to predict the stock price.
i used a API key from alphavantage website,to transfer stock data from aplhavantage to my website.
Alpha Vantage is a popular website that provides free and paid APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for historical and real-time financial data.
as the Alpha Vantage website works on US based stock exchangeit has a limited access to international stocks.
as for my API key it is a free tier so it has a more limited asscess to socks and as well as data transfer count.
